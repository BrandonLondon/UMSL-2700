1. [25 points] Exercise #3.29, p. 115: write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and radii of 2 circles and determines whether the second circle is inside the first or overlaps the first, or neither of them. See details of the assignment on pp. 115 â€“ 116. Your output should show that your program correctly identifies all 3 possible cases.

1. [25 points] The standard format of a vehicle plate number in Missouri is CCD CDC, where C stands for an upper-case character, and D stands for a digit. Write a program to generate and display 10 random plate numbers.

1. [25 points] Exercise # 5.51, p.204: write a program that prompts the user to enter 2 strings and displays the largest common prefix of these strings. See examples of sample runs on p. 204. The output of your program should demonstrate both situations: when strings have a common prefix and when they don&#39;t.
